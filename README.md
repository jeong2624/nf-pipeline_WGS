This pipeline was designed based on my understanding of Nextflow acquired through self-study, as part of my role in a mini project.

It performs DNA sequencing analysis, covering the entire process from raw data quality control to variant calling.

This script will be continuously updated as I continue learning and exploring Nextflow.

The repository originated from https://github.com/BI-academic/nf-pipeline_WGS.
