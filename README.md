This repository was created by Jeong-Woon, Park on May 3, 2025.

It represents Jeong-Woonâ€™s first attempt at writing a Nextflow pipeline.

The pipeline performs DNA sequencing analysis, spanning from raw data quality control to variant calling.

This script will be continuously updated as I continue learning and exploring Nextflow.

The repository originated from https://github.com/BI-academic/nf-pipeline_WGS.
